# sodium

libsodium is a crypto library (written in c) that is known for its simple API well written documentation.

> It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl, with a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further.

## Sodium Friends

[Sodium Friends](https://github.com/sodium-friends/) is an org focused around developoing prebuilt libsodium node.js bindings and browser-fills for the libsodium primitives.


### [sodium-universal](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-universal)

A wrapper around [sodium-javascript](#sodium-javascript) and [sodium-native](#sodium-native).

### [sodium-native](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-native)

Low level bindings for libsodium written by the Sodium Friends team ([@mafintosh][maf] + [@emilbays][eb]).  Primary node bindings for libsodium

Additional development behind the scenes is occurring in

> 03:05 <emilbayes> Emil Bay bret: sodium-native is where development is, however it's a bit stuck at the moment as I tried to resolve how to have multiple versions of sodium in memory at the same time and play nice
03:06 bret: That's happening over here: https://github.com/emilbayes/libsodium-prebuilt Which is just the binary and some files to lazy bind all symbols, which will then be exposed in sodium-native. There's a couple of PR's open on sodium-native until this is done
03:06 bret: And sodium-javascript is the collection of primitives ported to javascript some way or another

These will be incorporated into the sodium-native package when done.

### [sodium-javascript](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-javascript)

WIP - a pure javascript version of sodium-native. Based on tweetnacl.

## Sodium Friends Ecosystem

Examples of interesting modules in the sodium ecosystem:

- [emilbayes/secretstream-stream](https://github.com/emilbayes/secretstream-stream): pre-shared key stream encryption.  Requires key exchange / setup / teardown.
- [emilbayes/sodium-uuid](https://github.com/emilbayes/sodium-uuid): Generate v4 UUIDs using libsodium's RNG
- [mafintosh/sodium-signatures](https://github.com/mafintosh/sodium-signatures): Sodium signatures that works in node and in the browser.  Used for signing and verifying content.  Based on sodium universal.
- [mafintosh/sodium-encryption](https://github.com/mafintosh/sodium-encryption): Sodium encryption that works in node and in the browser.  Based on sodium-native and tweetnacl.  Perhaps port to sodum-universal?
- [poga/encrypted-message](https://github.com/poga/encrypted-message): sending encrypted messages between two ed25519 key pairs generated by sodium-signatures.


## History

libsodium is based on a project called NaCL

### Node-Sodium

Node sodium was the first module to write node.js binding to libsodium.

- [paixaop/node-sodium](https://github.com/paixaop/node-sodium)

A fork called node-sodium-prebuilt was the first attempt to prebuild those bindings.

- [mafintosh/node-sodium-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/node-sodium-prebuilt)

[sodium-native](#sodium-native) is a rewrite of those bindings.

> 21:49 <bret> mafintosh: whats the relationship between https://github.com/mafintosh/node-sodium-prebuilt and https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-native ?
00:49 <ralphtheninja> lms bret: afaik, node-sodium-prebuilt was the first attempt to get prebuilt binaries for node-sodium
00:50 well, hence the name :)
